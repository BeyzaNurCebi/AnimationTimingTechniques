# AnimationTimingTechniques

###### we used three techniques and wrote three functions

## tech1(): uses NativeScript animate() function

## tech2(): we create our animation by using animation-helpers.ts wroted by us.

## tech3(): again we used the algorithm that we wrote same as tech2() but for curve part we downloaded a package called "d3-ease" and this package involves some mathematical operations for us. To download "npm i d3-ease --save" after that to see decleration type "@types/d3-ease" in devDependicies and run npm i. After all these import {...} from 'd3-ease' whatever you want. And use that in curve part like we did in tech3().
